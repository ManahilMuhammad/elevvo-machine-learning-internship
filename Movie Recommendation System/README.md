# üìΩ Movie Recommendation System
## ‚úçÔ∏é Overview
This project is part of my work as a Machine Learning Engineer intern at Elevvo. It allows users to **select and rate a list of movies** that they have watched. Depending on this selection, the system **recommends a list of unseen movies** to the user. This recommendation is made using the user's choice of algorithm - they are free to choose between **User-based Collaborative Filtering**, **Item-based Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorisation** for advanced recommendations.
