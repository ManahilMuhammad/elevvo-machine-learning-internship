# Elevvo Internship Projects
Welcome to my journey as a **Machine Learning Engineer** Intern at Elevvo! This repository is home to 4 different projects related to Machine Learning and Data Visualisation. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of ML, including **classification**, **regression**, **recommendation** and **clustering**.

## Projects
### 1. Movie Recommendation System
Allows users to **select and rate a list of movies** that they have watched. Depending on this selection, the system **recommends a list of unseen movies** to the user. This recommendation is made using the user's choice of algorithm - they are free to choose between **User-based Collaborative Filtering**, **Item-based Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorisation** for advanced recommendations.
### 2. Forest Cover Type Classification
Predicts the **forest cover type** of a particular area depending on its environmental characteristics, such as the soil type in the area and its distance to the nearest water body. It uses an **XGBoost classification model**.
### 3. Student Score Prediction
**Predicts students' final exam scores** based on their study habits, such as the number of hours they spent studying. The user is free to choose the model, i.e. **linear** or **polynomial**, used to make the prediction and compare results.
### 4. Customer Segmentation
Uses **annual income** and **spending score** to cluster customers into groups for further analysis, such as for marketing and business insights. It utilises the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters. The project includes data visualisations for clusters using **K-Means** as well as **DBSCAN**.
