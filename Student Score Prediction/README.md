# 𝄜 Student Score Prediction
## ✍︎ Overview
This project is part of my work as a Machine Learning Engineer intern at Elevvo. It is used to **predict students' final exam scores** based on their study habits, such as the number of hours they spent studying. The user is free to choose the model, i.e. **linear** or **polynomial**, used to make the prediction and compare results.
