# ‚∏ô Forest Cover Type Classification Model
## ‚úçÔ∏é Overview
This project is part of my work as a Machine Learning Engineer intern at Elevvo. It predicts the **forest cover type** of a particular area depending on its environmental characteristics, such as the soil type in the area and its distance to the nearest water body. It uses an **XGBoost classification model**. 
## ‚ñ∏ How to Use
### Enter Parent Folder
Make sure to enter the folder within which the `forest_cover_type_classification.py` file is located
### Install Dependencies
Run `pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib`
### Run the Program
Run `python forest_cover_type_classification.py`
## üïÆ Dataset
The project uses the **Covertype** dataset from **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
