# 🔎︎ Customer Segmentation
## ✍︎ Overview
This project is part of my work as a Machine Learning Engineer intern at Elevvo. It uses **annual income** and **spending score** to cluster customers into groups for further analysis, such as for marketing and business insights. It utilises the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters. The project includes data visualisations for clusters using **K-Means** as well as **DBSCAN**.
